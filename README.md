# The Crate Stacking Game

### What is this?
This is a terminal clone of a friend's game. My version is simalar but different it's own unique ways. This is kind of like candy crush or tetris.

In this game you a crane/claw that manages a warehouse. Your goal is prevent the warehouse filling up with too many crates. To do this you can stack three crates that are the same colour and type to crunch into a higher teir crate. The more crate you crunch the higher your score becomes.

The colour teir list is:
- blue
- cyan
- green
- yellow
- red
- magenta
- white
Also the higher the teir the less likely the crate is going to spawn

There are different type of crates:

┏━┓ Basic Crate\n
┗━┛ The higher the colour teir the more points you get when you crunch it.

┓┳┏ TNT Crate\n
┛┻┗ On explosion it will destroy the crates around it or end the game if the player is holding it. The higher colour teir the crate is the bigger the explosion.

┏┓┓ Heavy Crate\n
┗┗┛ This crate can't be picked up by the claw becuase it's too heavy.

┗┳┛ Unbreakable Crate\n
┏┻┓ Can't be destroyed by a tnt crate.

Aim of the Game
- Stack as many crates for as long as possible
- Stack three of the same crate type and colour to crunch them into a higher teir colour
