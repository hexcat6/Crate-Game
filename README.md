# The Crate Stacking Game

### What is this?
This is a terminal clone of a friend's game. My version is similar but different in its unique ways. This is kind of like Candy Crush or Tetris.

In this game, you are a crane/claw that manages a warehouse. Your goal is to prevent the warehouse from filling up with too many crates. To do this you can stack three crates that are the same colour and type to crunch into a higher-tier crate. The more crate you crunch the higher your score becomes.

The colour tier list is:
- blue
- cyan
- green
- yellow
- red
- magenta
- white
Also the higher the tier the less likely the crate is going to spawn

There are different types of crates:

┏━┓ Basic Crate

┗━┛ The higher the colour tier the more points you get when you crunch it.

┓┳┏ TNT Crate

┛┻┗ On explosion, it will destroy the crates around it or end the game if the player is holding it. The higher the colour tier of the crate is the bigger the explosion.

┏┓┓ Heavy Crate

┗┗┛ This crate can't be picked up by the claw because it's too heavy.

┗┳┛ Unbreakable Crate

┏┻┓ It can't be destroyed by a TNT crate.

┻┳┻ Virus Crate

┳┻┳ Infects other crates in the same column which disables their ability to crunch.

┓?┏ Item Crate

┗━┛ Give you a random positive effect
